For our project, we analyzed a dataset containing Amazon customer reviews, comprising millions of product reviews dating back to 1995. This dataset includes a collection of reviews written on the Amazon.com marketplace for various product categories, along with associated metadata, spanning from 1995 to 2015. For this project, we pursued a series of questions. 

 The question we pursued was to determine what type of product sold by Amazon has the highest and lowest ratings among customers. To pursue this question, we read through each CSV file, which contains multiple products of the same category, and calculated the average rating. Then, we compared the average ratings for each product category and identified the ones with the highest and lowest ratings.
